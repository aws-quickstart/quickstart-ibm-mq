This Quick Start builds the IBM MQ environment by using a pre-built Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with IBM MQ installed on an Ubuntu operating system.

This deployment requires an IBM MQ license. To use the Quick Start in a production environment, sign up for an https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/subscribe?formid=urx-17867[IBM MQ program license^] (requires an IBMid). You must place the license key in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and specify its location. (For more information, see link:#_sign_up_for_an_ibm_mq_license
//TODO "step 2" link doesn't seem to resolve.
[step 2].)

If you donâ€™t have a license, the Quick Start uses an IBM MQ trial license, which allows 90 days of free usage in a non-production environment. After that time, the queue manager expires. Purchase support at an additional cost, or use the forums.

If the license file is in place when the stack is created, the IBM MQ server automatically uses the production license. To upgrade from a trial license to a production license after deployment, see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.ins.doc/q008943_.htm[Converting a trial license on Linux].

The http://www14.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/weblap/lap.pl?la_formnum=Z125-3301-14&li_formnum=L-APIG-AKHJ8V[IBM MQ software license agreement^] details the licensing terms. When you launch this Quick Start, you are asked to read and agree to the terms.
