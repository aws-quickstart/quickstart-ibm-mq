== Test the deployment

When the AWS CloudFormation template successfully creates the stack, all server nodes run with the software installed in your AWS account.

In the following steps, you connect to IBM MQ through a web console to verify and explore the deployment.

Connect to the IBM MQ Console:

. Choose the URL of the Elastic Load Balancing endpoint for the IBM MQ Console, as shown in <<cfn_outputs>>.
. The https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/cwlp_about.html[Liberty server^] used by the IBM MQ Console is initially configured to use a self-signed certificate, so your browser may display the warning shown in <<connection_error1>>. Note that the screenshot was captured using Firefox v79.0; currently, Chrome v84.x does not allow users to bypass this warning.
+
We recommend that you update the self-signed certificate to a certificate that’s signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). For more information about setting up certificates, see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.sec.doc/q127940_.htm[Using client certificate authentication with the REST API and IBM MQ Console^].

The Console initially displays a landing page with quick links, as shown in <<landing_page1>>. Choose *Manage* to see the queue-management page, where you can create and edit queue managers. There are also quick links to *Create a queue manager* and *Create a queue*.
+
The *MQ Basics* tiles launch a short guide that describes some of the core concepts of messaging with IBM MQ, which is particularly useful if you are new to IBM MQ. There is also a link to the external *Learn MQ* website, where you can find tutorials and articles about IBM MQ.

You can use the IBM MQ Console to perform administrative tasks, such as stopping and starting queue managers and creating objects in queues and channels. In the following steps, use the Console to verify that the server works correctly, and add a message to a queue.

== Post-deployment steps
=== Connect to the IBM MQ server

It's possible to administer IBM MQ locally from the server. For more information, see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/q019950_.htm[Administering IBM MQ^].

To connect to the IBM MQ server instance, use SSH (Secure Shell) to connect to the bastion host instance in your VPC. Use an SSH agent to forward your private key upon connection. For more information, see https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/using-ssh-agent-forwarding/[Using SSH agent forwarding^].

WARNING: Do not copy your private key to the bastion host instance.

== Deploying with Control Tower
{partner-product-name} can be deployed in a Control Tower environment. To accomplish this, we make use of https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/customizations-for-aws-control-tower/?did=sl_card&trk=sl_card[Customizations for AWS Control Tower] solution. A folder labeled "ct" has been provided in the repository for this Quick Start to aid in the deployment.

After the https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/customizations-for-aws-control-tower/?did=sl_card&trk=sl_card[Customization for AWS Control Tower] solution has been deployed, use the contents of the "ct" folder (located in the root of the GitHub repositoy) to customize your deployment.
----
└── ct
   ├── custom-control-tower-configuration
   │   └── manifest.yaml
   └── custom-control-tower-configuration.zip
----
The manifest.yaml file has been customized for the {partner-product-name} Quick Start. 

=== Review the manifest file.

Open and review the *manifest.yaml* file

*region:* Ensure the _region_ attribute references the region where the Customization for AWS Control Tower has been deployed. (The default region is "us-east-1")

NOTE: There is a second _region_ attribute located under the _resources_ section, that attribute is used to define the region where the Quick Start will be deployed. 

==== Review the _resources_ section
*resource_file:* The _resource_file_ attribute points to the public S3 bucket for the {partner-product-name} Quick Start, if you are deploying from your own s3 bucket, update this reference appropriately.

NOTE: There are other methods for deploying {partner-product-name} using Customization for AWS Control Tower, we have chosen to make use of the public s3 repository to ensure a consistent code base across the different deployment options. Visit the https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/customizations-for-aws-control-tower/?did=sl_card&trk=sl_card[Customizations for AWS Control Tower] solution page for additional information.

*parameters:* Update The _parameters_ attribute to suit your deployment. 

NOTE: Carefuly review and update these attributes, to ensure the deployment is successful.

*deployment_targets:* Ensure your _deployment_targets_ is configured for either your target account(s) or target OU(s)

*region:* Enter the _region_ where you wish to deploy the {partner-product-name-short} Quick Start. (The default region is "us-east-1")

=== Upload the manifest file
Compress the "manifest.yaml" file and name it *custom-control-tower-configuration.zip*
Upload the *custom-control-tower-configuration.zip* to the s3 bucket that was created by the Customization for AWS Control Tower solution. (custom-control-tower-configuration-_accountnumber_-_region_)
The file upload will trigger the customized pipeline that will deploy the Quick Start to your target accounts.

Visit the https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/customizations-for-aws-control-tower/?did=sl_card&trk=sl_card[Customizations for AWS Control Tower] solution page for additional information.
