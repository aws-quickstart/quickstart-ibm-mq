== Test the deployment

When the AWS CloudFormation template has successfully created the stack, all server nodes will be running with the software installed in your AWS account.

In the following steps, you’ll connect to IBM MQ through a web console to verify the deployment, and then use the console to explore IBM MQ features.

To connect to IBM MQ through the web console:

. Choose the URL of the Elastic Load Balancing endpoint for the IBM MQ console. This is the URL highlighted in <<cfn_outputs>>.
. The https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/cwlp_about.html[Liberty server^] used by the MQ Console is initially configured to use a self-signed certificate, so your browser may display the warning shown in <<connection_error1>>. Please note, the screenshots shown were captured from Firefox v79.0, currently Chrome v84.x does not allow the user to bypass this warning.
+
We recommend that you update the self-signed certificate to a certificate that’s signed by a trusted CA. For more information about setting up certificates, see the https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.sec.doc/q127940_.htm[IBM MQ documentation^].

The Console initially shows a landing page, shown in <<landing_page1>>. Here quick links to key areas of the user interface can be found. *Manage* takes you to the queue manager management page, where you can create and edit queue managers. There are also quick links to *Create a queue manager* and *Create a queue*.
+
The *MQ Basics* tiles will launch a short guide that will describe some of the core concepts of messaging with IBM MQ, which is particularly useful if you are new to IBM MQ. Also is a link to the external *Learn MQ* website where tutorials and articles to help users how to learn IBM MQ can be found.

You can use the IBM MQ Console to perform administration tasks such as stopping and starting queue managers and creating objects such as queues and channels. In the following steps, you’ll use the console to verify that the server is working correctly and add a message to a queue.

[start=4]
. From the landing page, choose *Manage*.

== Post deployment steps
=== Connect to the IBM MQ Server

It is possible to administer IBM MQ locally from the server. For more information about this option, see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/q019950_.htm[Administering IBM MQ^] in the IBM Knowledge Center.

To connect to the IBM MQ server instance, use SSH to connect to the bastion host instance in your VPC. Use an SSH agent to forward your private key on connection. For more information about SSH agents, see the https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/using-ssh-agent-forwarding/[GitHub documentation^].

WARNING: Do not copy your private key to the bastion host instance.
