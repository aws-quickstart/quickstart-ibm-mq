image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/quickstart-ibm-mq-eks-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
//TODO Vinod, There's no bullet item for the "Boot node" in the diagram (under the first public subnet). Should I remove that icon from the diagram? If we need to keep it, can you please add a bullet item for it?
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets, an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html[Amazon EKS managed node group^] to automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of the nodes (Amazon EC2 instances) for the EKS cluster. Each node comprises the following:
//TODO Vinod, The resource icon for the three IBM MQ servers in the diagram is for Amazon ECS. I don't see Amazon ECS mentioned in the bullets or diagram, so is that the correct resource icon?
** An IBM MQ server.
** An Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for persistent distributed storage to ensure high availability of the queue manager service and message data.
//TODO Vinod, I moved the "Classic load balancer" bullet from under the public subnets to the private subnets bullet because the diagram shows this item under private subnets. Is that correct?
** Classic load balancer automatically distributes connections to the active IBM MQ server. 
//TODO Vinod, Can you please add a bullet item for the Amazon EKS icon that's outside of the VPC?
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
//* <describe any additional components>.

//[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
